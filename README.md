# SerGIS Server Scripts

Scripts to help with sergis-server.

## Windows

In the `windows/` directory, there are 2 scripts:

- `update_sergis-client.js`: Updates the SerGIS Client in a web directory somewhere.
- `update_sergis-server.js`: Updates the SerGIS Server in a web directory somewhere, taking care of installing node modules, running `grunt`, etc.

Before running either of these, read through them to understand how to configure them and how they run.
